Emory Arts Underground is a student-run arts organization at Emory University in Atlanta, GA that aims to increase the accessibility of arts education on campus. We work with multiple departments and faculty to host unique events that teach new perspectives in the arts and how we can utilize these perspectives in all aspects of life. The year is wrapped up with a bang at our annual spring Emory Arts Showcase, which gives all students a platform to present their work or perform. More than 300 people came out to this year's Emory Arts Showcase event, The City of Enlightenment, which was sponsored in part by Late Night @ Emory, Campus Life, and Emory Catering. 70+ Emory performing and visual artists were showcased at the event, making for a night of revival of the underground arts culture at Emory University.
